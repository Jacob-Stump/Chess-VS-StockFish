# Chess-VS-StockFish
Play a game of chess against the StockFish 15+ Engine at various strengths.

The current iteration of this game only supports all type of white moves (except en passant capturing which I will add when the opponent move functionality is finished) 
and has no turn support until I can get the stockfish wrapper class written and functioning (soon TM).
